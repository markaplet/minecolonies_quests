# FTB Quest Line for Minecolonies
MC version: 1.20.1 [forge]
Depenencies: FTB Quests, Kubejs

## FTB Quest Installation
* Copy the `minecolonies.snbt` file to: `[modpack]/config/ftbquest/chapters/`
* Optional - Register the chapter in `chapter_groups.snbt`

## Kubejs Installation
The questline includes some title graphics just to make it look more fancy. 
These are not required for functionaly. If you skip this step then the quests still work but the images will be missing. 
I don't know how else to load the images other than kubejs. If there is a better way feel free to make a suggestion.

* Copy the entire `minecolonies` folder with contents to: `[modpack]/kubejs/assets/`

Relaunch the game and check the quest book.
